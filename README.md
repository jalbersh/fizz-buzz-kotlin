Included in this repo is some code demonstrating the use of JUnit tests and Spek tests, was well as Co-Routines and Higher-Order functions using Kotlin

JUnit Tests for FizzBuzz in kotlin/game and PrimeFactors in kotlin/etc
Spek Tests for FizzBuzz in kotlin/game
Co-Routines in Coroutines.kt in kotlin/etc
Higher-Order functions in higherOrderFunctions.kt in kotlin/etc
